              <p class="cutoff-text">PINYDIIT FOUNDATION, INC- (pronouns as &quot;Penydiet or Peny-hee-diet&quot;) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
                organization founded in January 2023 with the mission of providing school stationeries and
                scholarships to underserved students of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugee
                communities of South Sudanese origin within South Sudan and other East African countries.
                The foundation was named after the Awulian community&#39;s village in Nyuak Payam, Twic East
                County of Jonglei state, South Sudan.
                According to oral traditional history passed down on many generations, as time goes on, the
                Pinydiit village of Awulian became &quot;Penydiet,&quot; a pronunciation deviation from the word
                &quot;Pinydiit.&quot;
                Geographically, the village is located south of Bai Pawuoi, another Awulian village, and west of
                Pawuoi Wut (Awulain&#39;s cattle camp) in the Awulian territory. This information is based on the
                map of South Sudan&#39;s ten states, counties, and Payams, including Buma&#39;s boundaries. Buma
                formed the nucleus of government administrations in the country (Here, the description is only
                for informational purposes.)</p>

              <p class="cutoff-text">Our mission is to provide school stationaries and scholarships to underserved students of
                internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugee communities in 
                South Sudan and other East African countries. In developing countries, wars disrupt youths&#39;
                education, affecting future generations. This problem is even more daunting in a new country
                like South Sudan. The wars and internal conflicts disadvantage children of South Sudanese
                access to primary education. As wars forced communities to live in displaced and refugee
                camps for safety, children of South Sudan need/lack many items required for proper education,
                such as school supplies. In the developed world (e.g., the USA), school supplies like pencils,
                pens, and exercise books are taken for guaranteed. However, in the mentioned-above places
                (new and war-torn countries), these items are rare commodities that get in the way and strip
                kids of learning—disadvantaging generations of society.</p>
