              Over the years, Pinyindiit Foundation has achieved significant milestones in its mission to support the education of underserved students in South Sudan. One of its key achievements has been the distribution of school supplies, such as notebooks, pens, and pencils, to thousands of students in IDP and refugee communities.
              
              The organization has also awarded scholarships to many deserving students, enabling them to access quality education and pursue their dreams. Through these scholarships, Pinyindiit Foundation has helped to alleviate the financial burden on families who struggle to pay for their children's education.
              
              Furthermore, the organization has established partnerships with local schools and community organizations to support educational initiatives and promote access to education in the region. These partnerships have helped to create a network of support for underserved students and provided a platform for the organization to reach more young people in need.</p>

              <p class="cutoff-text">In developing countries, wars disrupt youths&#39; education, affecting future generations.
                This problem is even more daunting in a new country such as South Sudan. Sudanese (South)
                children are disadvantaged by the wars and internal conflicts that hide their access to primary
                education. Forced to live in displaced and refugee camps, children of South Sudan need/lack
                many items required for proper education, such as school supplies. PINYDIIT FOUNDATION&#39;s
                mission is to provide school stationaries and scholarships to underserved students of internally
                displaced persons (IDP) and refugee communities of South Sudan within South Sudan and other
                East African countries. In the developed world (e.g., USA), school supplies such as pencils, pens,
                and exercise books are taken for guarantee. However, in the mentioned-above places (new and
                wars-torn countries), these items are rare commodities that impair children&#39;s schooling and
                learning and disadvantage the next generations of society.</p>
